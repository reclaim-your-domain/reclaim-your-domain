<p>Reclaim Your Domain was born out of the Domain Of One’s Own initiative at the University of Mary Washington, and more specifically a hackathon at MIT Media Lab, where Kin Lane (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>), Jim Groom (<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>), and Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) plotted to develop a platform that would help educate people about their data and their digital identities and help them claim (or reclaim) better control over them.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Who We Are Online</strong><br />
We are spending a increasing amount of time online, using websites, applications, and this fast growing world is penetrating our physical worlds via our mobile phones, and a new breed of Internet connected devices. We have thousands of years of history in defining our physical domains, but what makes up our online domains, and do we actually have control over what is ours?</p>

<p><strong>Establishing Your Own Domain</strong><br />
Helping the average person understand what an online domain is, such as .com, or the numerous other top level domains, is one of the most important things you can do in the current digital age. Domain education is more than just buying a .com, it is about learning about DNS, and how to setup websites, tools and systems within your domain.</p>

<p><strong>Educating At Every Step</strong><br />
The primary mission of Reclaim Your Domain is to educate people about defining and owning their online domain. Each part of Reclaim Your Domain will have an accompanying educational component--Reclaim Your Domain is about education first, and technology second.</p>

<p><strong>>Modular Building Blocks</strong><br />
From reclaiming your blog from Tumblr, to taking control of photos on Instagram, every Reclaim Your Domain lesson will be small, bit-size chunks of learning, with accompanying code, tools and service to execute the goals of the lesson. Modular building blocks will be the hallmark of Reclaim Your Domain, providing resources for users that do one thing, and do it well, helping the user learn all along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Re-Use Along The Way</strong><br />
Reclaim Your Domain isn’t about building yet another platform, it is about re-using existing tools and services from Wordpress to If This Then That, with an emphasis on open source tools, that users can put to work with minimal investment. The are plenty of great tools and services available online, helping users understand the pros and cons of various services, is the mission of Reclaim Your Domain.</p>

<p>We are still defining what Reclaim Your Domain is, and if it is still unclear to you, it is the same for us. Kin Lane is pushing forward with defining his domain, looking to beta test one possible approach to reclaiming our own domain. However what reclaim might mean for one, could be something entirely different for others—there is no single vision for reclaim.</p>

<p>This project is ongoing, looking for input, and funding.
