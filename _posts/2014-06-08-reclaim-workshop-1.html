<p>As part of the <a href="http://ewprogram.com/incubator/">Domain of One&#8217;s Own Incubator</a> at Emory University earlier this year, Kin and Audrey facilitated a workshop (a discussion, really) about &#8220;Reclaim Your Domain.&#8221; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMqfckH_0bgI0t8CoeH7e0Ta-MrB1pmmqiyyiloEpDc/edit?usp=sharing">The Google Doc can be found here</a>. But in the spirit of &#8220;reclaim,&#8221; those resources are also posted below.</p>

<p><em>How do we build an alternative to the corporate web? How do we &#8220;re-decentralize the Net&#8221;?</em></p>

<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> (from <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-your-domain-honing-the-vision/">Reclaim Your Domain: Honing the Vision</a>)
* Historical Internet Archive
* Web Literacy (End User and development)
* Self presentation and preservation
* Flips the web back to the personal, self-determination
* About the people, scaling the possibilities of the individual to more easily control their small piece of the web</p>

<p><strong>What are the obstacles?</strong>
* Corporate tech is slick and easy and free! Whee!
* Lack of data portability, lack of standards
* Uncertainty about where to start
* Lack of tech skills
* The tech industry is not necessarily interested in people reclaiming their data and owning their domain; the tech community is not necessarily supportive or welcoming
* There are technologies institutions force us to use &#8211; at work, at school, etc &#8211; and data portability and data portability are not institutional priorities</p>

<p><strong>So now what:</strong>
* How do we accomplish this?
* What can be reclaimed?
* Where can we start?
* What are alternatives to &#8220;reclaiming your domain&#8221;?</p>
